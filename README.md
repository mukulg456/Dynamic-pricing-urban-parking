The goal of the project is to build pricing models that dynamically adjust parking fees in urban areas based on demand, traffic, occupancy, and other contextual factors. It includes:
â€¢	A Baseline Linear Model
â€¢	A Demand-Based Pricing Model
â€¢	Optionally a Competitive Pricing Model
â€¢	Visualization using Bokeh

2. Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
â€¢	A simple model where price increases linearly with occupancy ratio.
â€¢	alpha is a sensitivity factor (default = 0.1).
â€¢	Example: If the parking lot is full, the price goes up from its base.

3. Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing
ðŸ”¹ Demand Calculation
â€¢	Demand is a weighted combination of:
o	Occupancy ratio (most important)
o	Queue length
o	Traffic condition (negative effect)
o	Whether it's a special day
o	Type of vehicle (e.g., truck vs. bike)
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Pricing Based on Demand
â€¢	Adjusts base price using demand and elasticity factor lambda_.
â€¢	Prices are clipped to within 50% to 200% of base price for fairness.

 Visualization with Bokeh
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_notebook
â€¢	Creates a line chart of demand_price over LastUpdatedTime using Bokeh.
â€¢	This helps visualize how pricing varies dynamically with time.
